% Meeting with Endrizzi
% 
 
% Stefan, interest in 
- integrating air convection 
- soil compressibility

% Natural convection in talus slopes
% During winter, exterior temperature is smaller than interior
% During summer, exterior temperature is higher  than interior

% Debris covered landform, air flux is relevant

% It is possible to assume a REV for air phase 
% Van genutchen, permeability for air, permeabilty for water

% In terms of equations is paractically the same that using Richards for water

% Density variations are only relevant in Darcy equation
% Density is variable and is a function of temperature
% Similar to current geotop with richards 

% For energy, would be the same than today, plus an additional term for air

% Time loop, solves energy balance, water balance until convergence
% An idea is to introduce the air balance within the time loop 

% Fluids are related by means of permeability
% But they can be solved independently
% More water means less air

% From air perspective, poroisty might change
% Total water content is water plus ice 

% Currently there is no convection of water in energy balance 
% At large scale is not important for water 
% But the idea is to introduce air convection

% Geotop does not compute convergence between air and energy 

% Water movement is considering constant energy
% Compute water and then energy independently

% Is this approach suitable ?
% 

% Water flow in 1D is very limited according to Endrizzi
% He thinks that lateral effects could be important, only vertical flow might be unphysical
% 

% Add another state variable, for air temperature
% The assumption is that the temperautre is uniform within the REV, that means, that each phase has the same temperature
% That is valid when water is slow

% Convection contribution from water, might be important, although the assumption is that air flow is more relevant. 

% Temperature water + soil, and air temeprature different 

% Edrizzi is not sure about Darcy for gas phase
% Fluxes from summer and winter is 3D, exactly as the water

% Suction is not considered for air, that means only positive pressures
% It is a function of air temperature. Air flow will be determined by temperature 


% Add another equation plus gas temperature
% Global energy equation, that temperature is also used for changes at the surface, it is the most important, the solid temperature

% Water and solid temperature are the same
% 
% How do you express energy changes between phases ?
% GZ: similar to ficks law 

% Energy, is solved 1D, only vertical gradients, it may be important lateral changes 
% Lateral interchanges is used in richards equation

% Energy balance is 1D or 3D ?    
% At the surface might be 3D
% At the soil, geotop uses land surface models, 1D, only vertical due to high spatial scales.
% Geotop does not consider that lateral fluxes for energy
% Edrizzi thinks it is important
% Complexity of energy equation comes from the surface

% It is possible to consider uncoupled, instead of coupled.
% Previous temperature can be used for computing lateral terms: Risk is the usage of a small time step. Depends on air flux speed. IF the flux is fast, then resolution cannot be uncoupled.
% 

% Interesting thing of geotop is coupling with surface, that is the complicated part
% 
% Geotop solves a linear system
% He thinks adding a simple case adding source terms, using the temperature of the previous time step
% Analyze validity, by introducing source terms and check how the matrix solver behaves. 

% Check Rayleigh number

% Temperature at surface changes at lot, but within the soil, does not change so much.
% Air flux is within subsurface and surface
% If snow, maybe the flux diminishes

% Edrizzi: Water vapor it is important also within the snow

% Negative pressure fwould be the difference between airbalance v/s waterbalance.

% Seasonaly frozen soil.
